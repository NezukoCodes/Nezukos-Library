# Introduction

From what I understand, cryptocurrency is just another form of currency available digitally. It can be used to buy goods and stuff, just like with real cash. A really well known form of Crypto is "Bitcoin".

Of course, there are many things to know and learn about Cryptocurrency. Like, what the heck is "Stacking", "Blockchain" and "Mining"?! I don't even fully understand these terms myself but slowly, I'll familiarise myself with these and get better at investing in Crypto.
